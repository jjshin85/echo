# Echo
Echo is a social media web-app that maps the intersection of songs, places, and memories. Users can select a location and add a song and comment to that location, sharing their songs, impressions, and echoes of their memories.

Echo was built using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, jQuery, React.js, as well as the Spotify and Google Maps APIs.

Materialize was used for styling.

Capybara and Rspec were used for testing.
